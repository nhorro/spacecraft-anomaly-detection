# spacecraft-anomaly-detection

This project contains experiments with algorithms to identify anomalies in multivariate series with a focus on spacecraft applications.

Each experiment is a jupyter notebook that generates one or more models to process multivariate series.

Dependencies are contained in a conda environemnt.

~~~bash
conda env create -f anomalies-env.yml
conda activate anomalies-env.yml
~~~
